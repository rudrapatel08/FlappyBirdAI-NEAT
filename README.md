# FlappyBirdAI-NEAT
This was a way for me to learn the NEAT program with the Tech with Tim tutorial on [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGHA-elMrxI) An AI that plays a version of Flappy Bird. The AI used the NEAT python modules. And the Flappy Bird game is programmed on python using tutorials.

# Instructions
Run the *main.py* and watch the AI learn and train itself to play flappy bird.
